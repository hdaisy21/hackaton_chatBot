# Hackaton_chatBot
Our project is a chatbot that will allow  a patients to gain medical help anywhere around the world, addressing the issue with health not always being readily avaliable to Patients due to many challenging factors including location, income, and disability.This gives a way for patients to self-diagnost with the assistance of our chatbot trained with Machine Learning and AI so patients can have a temporary solution to minor health problem and give them time to see help from a doctor based on diagnosis. 

This repo has the code for the frontend of the website allowing user to create a account that is stored in the dictionary in flask backend. Once account is created, Patient can use username and password they created to login giving them access to the  website homepage where they can acess resources and read about our webpage.

# Set up flask
1. Install flask:  pip install Flask
   
3. Create an environment: python -m venv venv

3.Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate

    On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

4. create a app.py file in environment: The app.py in the backend folder is the one I had in my flask enviornment.
   
5. once you have app.py you use "python -m flask run" to run the backend as you are inside the flask eviorment.This will generate a link that can be hosted on your browser. Then you can proceed with opening the login.html to start testing login page, create page, and homepage.
